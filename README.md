# edge-github-dark
Edge plugin to give GitHub a dark theme. It's only been briefly tested but you should be able to side load this with Chrome as well if you don't want to use Stylish (ref: [GitHub-Dark#455](https://github.com/StylishThemes/GitHub-Dark/issues/455)).

Uses [GitHub-Dark](https://github.com/StylishThemes/GitHub-Dark) and the Monokai theme.
